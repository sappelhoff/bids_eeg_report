BIDS-EEG Report
===============

The Brain Imaging Data Structure ([BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/))
describes a standard to organize neuroimaging data.

This repository contains code for producing figures used in the report on the
BIDS Extension Proposal 6 (`BEP006`), which adds electroencephalography (EEG)
to BIDS.

Click on the `launch binder` badge to run the code interactively.

Figure 2 will have to be compiled using Latex. See `figures/fig_dir_overview/`.
